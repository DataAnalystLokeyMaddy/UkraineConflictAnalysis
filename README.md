# 🇺🇦 **Ukraine Conflict Analysis**  

## 📂 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze the Ukraine conflict from 2020 to 2025 using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in event types, regional distribution of conflicts, and assessing the impact of different event types in terms of fatalities.
